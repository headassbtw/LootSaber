# LootSaber
A mod that adds loot boxes (containing random sabers/notes/platforms etc) to beat saber

IMPORTANT: AssetDatabase.json is the file that the mod uses to determine what assets are downloaded, and where to get them. THIS FILE IS NOT LOCAL, IT STAYS ON THE REPO AND THE MOD FETCHES IT FROM HERE.
YOU MAY PUT YOUR OWN ASSETS IN HERE, although PLEASE be honest with the tiers, 1 being alright and 5 being god-tier.


Planned Features:
change coin system to XP system
add more UI
add animations, make it more like lootbox openings in other games

Current Featrures:
downloading random assets from the db
hooking song results to get score, FC/S/SS/PB
