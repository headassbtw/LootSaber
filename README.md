# LootSaber
A mod that adds loot boxes (containing random sabers/notes/platforms etc) to beat saber

IMPORTANT: AssetDatabase.json is the file that the mod uses to determine what assets are downloaded, and where to get them. THIS FILE IS NOT LOCAL, IT STAYS ON THE REPO AND THE MOD FETCHES IT FROM HERE.
YOU MAY PUT YOUR OWN ASSETS IN HERE, although PLEASE be honest with the tiers, 1 being alright and 5 being god-tier.
