# LootSaber
A mod that adds loot boxes (containing random sabers/notes/platforms etc) to beat saber

IMPORTANT: AssetDatabase.json is the file that the mod uses to determine what assets are downloaded, and where to get them.
YOU MAY PUT YOUR OWN ASSETS IN HERE, although PLEASE be honest with the tiers, 1 being alright and 5 being god-tier.
